\section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}
The analysis is divided into three different categories.
However, it should be said at this point that these categories will have overlaps.
Therefore, to avoid mentioning topics several times they will be mentioned only once.

\subsection{User}
% Definiton of mental distress?
% CEO & Founder explanation
% Design for everyone? (implicit) - Carina Bach

% Does it collect data, what does the app do with the data?
% How does it suggest to approach mental health? - Selfmanagement? Through Interaction?
% Norms and values: Culture sees mental problems as weakness -> Woebot doesn't solve this norm, it rather fights the weakness

% Human - AI Relations (Personification of Woebot?) - Concerns about therapeutic bond?

% GIFs + Emojis - Personal but might be annoying/ not for every target group

\subsection{Design}
