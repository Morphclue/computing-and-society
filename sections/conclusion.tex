\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The analysis is not intended to badmouth the application in any way.
Only concerns are raised here because this application is intended to be used by people who are currently having problems in their lives.
For this reason special care should be taken.
The app not only includes the weaknesses mentioned in the analysis, but also many positive aspects.
An example of a positive context is that the app can be used by blind people.
Other positive examples of the application are that Woebot is easily scalable and can be used immediately.
This counteracts the problems that there is a shortage of therapists in many places and appointments are made late.
A conversational agent could be a possible solution for offering therapeutic services in the future.
However, many social, ethical and technical problems must first be solved.
For this reason, further research must be carried out whether a conversational agent is the step in the right directions or alternatives are needed.
